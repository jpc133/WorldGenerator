# World Generation tools

These are a set of tools to help with generating 2D square cell grid based worlds.

## World Generator
The world generator project is for testing and tieing the tools together to generate a world, the actual tools are designed to be used from a game project rather than from this project so I've used this project for testing rather than 'production' use.

## L-System

L-systems are often used for generating plants / trees but can also be used for fractal style generation of things such as roads. In this project it refers to a process for building a sentence based on an initial sentence that is transformed through applying rules, these sentences are formed of letters which are used as instructions for generating structures.

## Cellular Automata

Cellular automata can be used to do a variety of tasks, a well known application of cellular automata is for Conway's game of life which simulates an approximation of basic life. By varying the rules used different outcomes can be reached, if for instance you want to generate roads you can codify the rules by which tiles of road are placed, if randomness if added the results can be more interesting and useful.
